# Natural Language Processing API

Modern technological era has reshaped traditional lifestyle in several domains. The medium of publishing news and events has become faster with the advancement of Information Technology (IT). IT has also been flooded with immense amounts of data, which is being published every minute of every day, by millions of users, in the shape of comments, blogs, news sharing through blogs, social media micro-blogging websites and many more. Manual traversal of such huge data is a challenging job; thus, sophisticated methods are acquired to perform this task automatically and efficiently. News reports events that comprise of emotions-good, bad, neutral. Sentiment analysis is utilized to investigate human emotions (i.e., sentiments) present in textual information.

This was the motivation to build this web app using Natural Language Processing API. 
After registering for the API key, we can hide the key in the .env file which makes sure that the variables are treated as environment variables and are not pushed to git when uploading or when someone tries to clone the repository.

The application allows users to type in any URL containing an article or a blog. Then, using Aylien API, the app analyses the sentiment of it through getting insight about the author's polarity and subjectivity, and the confidence in this analysis.

## How to get started

`cd` into root directory of the folder i.e. Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing and run ```npm install```. Then run ```npm start``` to start the server 

Open another terminal window in the same root directory as above and run ```npm run build-dev``` to get the app running.
